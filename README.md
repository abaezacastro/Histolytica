A repository of the files to simulate the population dynamics of Entamoeba histolytica in Mexico City

In this files I described the step to define a partially observed stochastic process of the population dynamics of Entoamoeba histolytica in Iztapalapa, which is one of the municipality of Mexico City. 
The method use is the Partially observed Monte-carlo process with the tool of the R package (POMP), developed by Aaron King https://kingaa.github.io/pomp from The University of Michigan.
